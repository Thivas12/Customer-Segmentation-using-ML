# Customer-Segmentation-using-ML
In this project, I built a prototype of a Customer Segmentation model

# What is Customer Segmentation?
In marketing, market segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared charateristics.

Customer segmentation is **the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics-** such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively. These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions building a marketing persona.

# Application of Customer Segmentation
**Customer Segmentation** is performed in Machine Learning / AI to perform several different purposes. Some of the places where we can use these are:
 * Demographic Segmentation
 * Geographic Segmentation
 * Technographic Segmentation
 * Behavioral Segmentation
And More...

# Understanding the Problem Statement
We have a data set which contains certain parameters and based on those parameters some clusters are assigned to them. We will see how we can assign these clusters and will try to do some analysis on the same.
